# Gradient-Descent-and-Regularized-Logistic-Regression-Implementation
 Implement and compare gradient descent with fixed and exponential learning rates on L1 and L2 objectives. Extend to regularized logistic regression with L1 and L2 penalties, using cross-validation to select the best regularization parameter. Apply models to the South Africa Heart Disease dataset.
